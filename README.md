# ⚙️ RAG Backend – Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

A backend AI system that enhances LLM responses with real-world knowledge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
This project retrieves relevant context from custom data sources and generates accurate, grounded answers using OpenAI GPT and LangChain.


## 🚀 Overview

The RAG Backend combines vector-based document retrieval with **LLM reasoning to deliver precise and context-aware responses.  
Instead of relying only on pre-trained model data, this system searches through stored documents, retrieves relevant chunks, and uses them to generate final answers.

Ideal for building **AI chatbots, knowledge assistants, or enterprise Q&A systems** that require factual accuracy.


## 🧩 Tech Stack
